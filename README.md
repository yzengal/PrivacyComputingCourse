# PrivacyComputingCourse
This GitHub repository is the project of "**Efficient Privacy Computing for Large-Scale Federated Data**" in the undergraduate research class at Beihang University.

## Environment

Linux: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS   
GCC/G++: 11.2.0   
CMake: 3.19.7
gRPC: 1.62.0   

## Independent Project

### Lecture 2: RPC

The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) project is a comprehensive learning initiative designed to empower students with hands-on experience in utilizing the powerful open-source **gRPC** framework. This project not only delves into the intricacies of building and deploying RPC systems but also fosters an understanding of crucial development tools such as **CMake**, which plays a pivotal role in managing build processes and dependencies.

Through this project, students can gain practical knowledge on how to define service interfaces in Protocol Buffers (**ProtoBuf**), implement these services in their preferred programming languages (e.g., C/C++ in the example), and then seamlessly communicate between different processes or even different servers. The focus on CMake as a build system helps students appreciate the importance of automation and reproducibility in software development, enabling them to streamline their build and deployment processes.

Please refer to the project folder [Lecture2_RPC](Lecture2_RPC) for more details and instructions.
